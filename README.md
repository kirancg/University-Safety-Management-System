University Safety Management System

Safety departments are required to proactively ensure the safety of the people.They need to be prepared for all adversities.This process is impeded if the organization is not structured properly. 

We aim to provide a better approach for organizing their records with the help of a database system.The system will help the safety department to reduce the time required for data processing and spend more time providing security to the university community.
